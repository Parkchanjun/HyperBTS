Hyper-BTS Dataset: Scalability and Enhanced Analysis of Back TranScription (BTS) for ASR Post-Processing

## Introduction

[NLP & AI Lab](http://nlp.korea.ac.kr/), Korea University. 

*Chanjun Park, Jaehyung Seo, Seolhwa Lee, Junyoung Son, Hyeonseok Moon, Sugyeong Eo, Chanhee Lee, Heuiseok Lim*. **Hyper-BTS Dataset: Scalability and Enhanced Analysis of Back TranScription (BTS) for ASR Post-Processing**. **Our paper was published in findings of EACL 2024**. 

This dataset is an extension of the previous study [BTS: Back TranScription for Speech-to-Text Post-Processor using Text-to-Speech-to-Text](https://aclanthology.org/2021.wat-1.10/).

## Hyper-BTS Datasets
The dataset is only open to the Train and Validation datasets that have undergone Parallel Corpus Filtering.
The Hyper-BTS dataset is based on data sourced from TED Talks, AI-HUB, and the National Institute of Korean Language.
